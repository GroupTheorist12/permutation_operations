#### Permutation Examples

A permutation is the order left to right that a set of objects can be arranged. Thus the set {1,2} has the permutations:   {1,2},  {2,1}. The number of permutations for a given set of objects is **n!** where n is the number of objects (order) and ! is n factorial.

A permutation can be written as a two rows of numbers. The permutations of the order 2 set \{1,2\} can be written as:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1&2\\
1&2\\
\end{array}
\right)
\quad
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1&2\\
2&1\\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
